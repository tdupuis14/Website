<center><ol>
	My name is Taylor Dupuis. I'm a student at Springfield Technical Community College.<br> In May 2016, I will be graduating with my Associate's degree in Computer and IT Security.<br>
	This January I began a fourteen week IT training program at The Tech Foundry.<br> This program gave me hands on experience to go along with my formal education.<br> 
	I'm hoping to find a career in the IT field that will allow me to further my knowledge of the field.
